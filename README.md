### Developers
If you wish to contribute to the source, you may clone the src-main branch, make the modifications, and issue a pull request. We will assume that if you know how to code for the project, you know how to use Git or a VCS to handle it yourself. However, if you are meeting with issues, you can make an issue request in the Github.

When decided, the code owner will compile the update target jar into the main release so that official app is updated.
